<b> TIME DOMAIN PERIODICITY MINING PIPELINE </b>

Our periodicity-search pipeline includes nonparametric and parametric light curve modelling, based on different time-domain period-detection algorithms, and a set of techniques for determining the significance level of potential periods. The proposed pipeline combines different time-domain algorithms, including machine learning of light curves, to exploits the information. The pipeline outputs are the extracted light curve periodic features (periodicities, uncertainties, periods probability) which will serve especially the TVS and AGN science collaborations, as well as any other interestred group, for further variability investigations.

The software is currently under development, and it will be developed as a python package available to download and distribute using the PyPi repository. We have made this choice in order to distribute, maintain, and develop software and its versions more easily. Also, the package can be easily installed and executed on the RSP platform.
