<b> TIME DOMAIN PERIODICITY MINING PIPELINE </b>
 Framework for 2D Hybrid Method; Q3 FY22 work done: Apr-Jun 2022,
preliminary repository https://github.com/LSST-sersag/periodicities

<ul> 
 <li>
Finalized module for WWZ wavelets (for non-homogeneous cadence) </li>
<li>
Finalized module for SUPERLETS(for homogenous cadences -modeled light
curves), which is useful for detection of fast transient oscillation events
that may be hidden in the averaged time-frequency spectrum by other
methods. </li> <li> Finalized module for cross correlation of wavelet coefficients
calculated with modules in a) and b).</li> <li> Finalized module for plotting 2D
Heatmaps obtained in module c) e) Finalized module for integration of 2D
Heatmaps into "periodogram-like representation" </li><li> Finalized module for
upper and lower error estimates of detected periods using FWHM of peaks and
mquantile method to detect points between 25th and 75th quantile.


Detailed explanations are yet further to come and can be easly be seen on <a href="https://github.com/LSST-sersag/periodicities/blob/main/periodicity/ShortTutorial.ipynb"> jupyter notebook </a>.
